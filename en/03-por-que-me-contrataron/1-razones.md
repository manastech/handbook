## The whys
First of all, we hired you because we consider you share the same values and principles which are important to us –if you have read any you highly disagree with, let us know soon! When we start off from a common base of shared values, everything else is about implementation details. Secondly, and paraphrasing [Joel Spolsky](http://www.amazon.com/Smart-Gets-Things-Done-Technical/dp/1590598385), we hired you because we think you're smart and can do stuff. That last bit is really important: we are a group of people who MAKE stuff. We don't just think, suggest and design; we sit down and do.
