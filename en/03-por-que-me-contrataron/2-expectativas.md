## Expectations
We don't expect anything other than you being who you are. Be yourself, bring your best every morning (or midday, your call), speak out when something is not to your taste, share ideas, try constantly to get better, help others, go for new things, do, relax, have fun.

From here on, this handbook is full of sections showing our efforts to help you achieve this. Feedback is always welcome.
