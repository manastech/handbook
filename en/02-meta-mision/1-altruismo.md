## Altruism
We want to contribute to the happiness of people that work at Manas. We all spend a significant part of our life in an "employment" situation, so we think it's fundamental that as far as possible, the workplace adds to personal development in all of its aspects. 

If you're unhappy or know of someone you think is unhappy, let others know and help us understand how to improve the situation. We hope you will enjoy your workday and as a complement you can check the [After office](../08-after-office/0-after-office.md) and [Holidays](../12-vacaciones/0-vacaciones.md) sections.
