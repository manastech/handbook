# Meta-mission
>"Think only on those things that are in line with your principles and can bear the light of day. The content of your character is your choice. Day by day, what you do is who you become. Your integrity is your destiny."
> --<cite>Heraclitus</cite>

We at Manas think that having a fixed destination implies missing the chance of discovering places we didn't know about, and that exploring new territory with the right people is a guarantee of results beyond the imaginable. It's because of this that instead of a mission statement set in stone, we make decisions and define our path guided by certain principles. Our mission is a meta-mission: to constantly find and improve ways to sustain and embody these principles.

In the following chapters we outline these values, but the real proof of how much we walk the talk is found in our day to day. The rest of this manual is an attempt to reflect on that.
