# Start me up

Start Me Up is our internal entrepreneurship program. It hopes to create an environment for innovation, creativity and investment, where you can explore interesting ideas. The short version is: you have an accumulative monthly budget you can use to develop products you are interested in, both by buying your own time, or buying someone else's, or investing in somebody else's idea. The projects don't necessarily have a profitable outcome, the whole point is having ideas which allow us to expand. If your project does generate income, then it is added to your budget according to the guidelines which follow. You can check your current budget in man.as/startmeup.
