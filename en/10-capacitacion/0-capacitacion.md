A wise man said: "Continuity is decay". We hope you can learn and grow continuously, and for that you will have a training budget with a monthly allowance.

You can use this budget on any sort of activity that'll help you grow in your role inside of Manas. English lessons, Software conferences, books and seminars are all valid examples. The only limits expenses are common sense and the whole of the budget put together.

The budget for training is shared, and guided by a very simple rule:

  * You can make an expense as long as the total you have spent since you started at Manas is less than the median of the expenses made by everybody else.

In other words, you can spend in training while you belong to the half of Manas who has spent the least on training. If the cumulative of your expenses is over the median, that is, if you belong to the half that spends the most, you'll have to wait until others use their budget before you can spend again.

You can also make shared expenses, in which case each participant is accounted for a share of the total cost.

When starting at manas, your account of cumulative expenses starts at the median.
