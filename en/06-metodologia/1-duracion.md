## Duration
Most projects we take last from a few weeks to a few months. You are free to choose these long projects if you enjoy working on a single project for a long time, watching it grow and having the chance to refactor code as the visibility of the problem improves. If, on the other hand, you'd rather start up new projects, rotate through topics and teams and solving new issues, you can decide on shorter projects or continuously switching between them.
