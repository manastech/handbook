## All for one
Even though most people are assigned to a particular project, you can make use of anyone in the entire team for whatever you need. Don't try to play the lone ranger, when you get stuck, are in doubt or want a second opinion, ask whoever you think will be able to help you. If they can't, they will surely be able to recommend someone who will.
