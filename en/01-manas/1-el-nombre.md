## The name
In Buddhist psychology, manas is the rational or intellectual faculty of the mind. Manas has both an active and passive function. In the passive mode it is responsible for reception, categorization, and interpretation of data received through the five senses. The process by which manas performs this function is the result of conditioning and habit, which can be modified through the exercise of self-awareness. In its active mode manas is responsible for the production of emotions and wishes.
