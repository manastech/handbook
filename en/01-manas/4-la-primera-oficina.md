## The first office
During another fit of naivety and while Argentinean economy was collapsing on its usual 10 year cycle, he rented an office in the posh Olivos neighbourhood. The office was close to the river but a little too close to the train tracks.
The office started as a rather empty space, although it could pass as minimalist. With time, improvements and expansions were made, but despite the efforts, the main issue was that the team had outgrown the space[^1] and the horizon of growth was non existent[^2]. After a few years in that beloved spot, Manas relocated to its current office, where we can opt to block the sunlight with curtains and celebrate the high ceilings playing real-life Angry Birds. But this is all recent history.
