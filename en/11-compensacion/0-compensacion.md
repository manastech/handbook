We want you to be rewarded for your work as fairly as possible, and in a company like ours we could not leave such an important decision to a single person. In Manas, your salary is not decided by your boss, or calculated from a 182-question survey where your teammates rank you from 1 to 5.

**Your salary is decided by everyone who works at Manas.**

How does this work? It's pretty simple: once every 6 months, we all get together for a couple of days and everyone recaps what they have been working on during the semester for the rest. When all presentations are done, everyone retreats into their own quiet space in the office and, through an anonymous system, fills out what he thinks is a fair salary for each of his coworkers. Your salary will end up the average of what all your coworkers think it should be.

Salaries are internally visible to everyone, and you will have that information when you're making your decision. We think that keeping it transparent solves a lot of problems, and does not generate any inconveniences.
