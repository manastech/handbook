We are all for multifaceted people, and we think that everything we do is subject to a different perspective given by our pastimes. Do you feel like doing yoga, swimming, origami or Japanese? Manas will take care of half the cost of whichever activity you want to take up. Acceptable ideas are sports, languages, courses, etc, anything illegal or immoral is excluded.
Ideally, you could share a little of the wisdom and experiences you've collected with the rest of the team.
Would you like to have the whole team at your favourite restaurant? Tell to Clara and Lu about this place, they'll take care of reservations, organizations and, of course, the check on the way out.
