Manas Handbook
==============

This text serves two simultaneous purposes that mutually feedback each other: it is a user manual which explains how some processes work inside [Manas](http://www.manas.com.ar) and it's also an instruction manual, as it describes certain goals we want to achieve. True to our principles, the text is in a repository where you can comment on it and send your change proposals. This text will always be a beta version. If you agree with a chapter of the manual, but you don't think it is being implemented correctly in reality, let your voice be heard loud and clear and help us correct what we can. If you disagree with parts of the manual, please suggest the change you'd like to see and help us implement it.
